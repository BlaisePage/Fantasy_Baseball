The object of this assignment is to come up with some way for evaluating players. How you might ask? However you want we might reply. You've heard about WAR and wOBA and replacement value and all sorts of ways to evaluate players, and now we're going to turn it into a competition with (fake) money on it (and a prize at the end). "

The least a player can go for is \\\\$1, while the most is \\\\$250-(# roster spots - 1). You'll have to use your money wisely to build the best team possible, however you can still use waivers and trades to keep your roster competitive."

A 2B/3B/HR is added on to the value of a hit, so a double is worth 5.6+2.9=8.5 points. These weights are based on wOBA/FIP, adjusted to keep pitchers and batter on a reatively level playing field. OF is any outfield position. UTIL is any batter, doesn't matter the position (kind of like a DH)."

   "source": [
    "No worries, in order to help even out the playing field a bit, here are some hints that can help you in the draft.  \n",
    "1. Try to get other people to spend their money on players that you don't want but you think that other people will. You can use ESPN draft rankings you help find discrepencies between your rankings and the ones that other people will see to help with that.  \n",
    "2. There's more than one strategy to building a team. You can blow all your money on some top tier talent and fill in the rest of your team with cheap players, or build a more balanced roster. Both can work.  \n",
    "3. There's position scarcity in baseball (some positions are deeper than others), meaning that the worst 2B on a roster might put up 1.9 points a game while the worst 1B on a roster might put up 2.5. Establishing a replacement level *wink wink* for each position can help you guage which players are more valuable just becuase of the position they play. \n",
    "4. Fantasy value does not always equal real life value. We don't care about defense and players have to play to score points. There might be some great guy sitting on an MLB teams bench, but he's not going to give you fantasy points if he's only playing every third day. Here, counting stats matter.  \n",
    "5. The league is only going to last a little over a month (the last day of points scoring will be 11:59pm on April 28th), meaning that prospects or players that won't be called up until midway through the season (Vlad Jr., Eloy) aren't realy worth drafting. You're welcome to ask if you don't know who those players are."

    "### Introduction ###\n",
    "Fantasy sports have become increasingly popular over the last decade with more and more participants becoming involved each year. With more players and larger leagues, it is difficult for individual participants to gain a competitive advantage over their adversaries using personally acquired knowledge alone. That is, routinely watching sports alone does not give fantasy sports competitors enough of an advantage to build reliable fantasy teams that consistantly out perform their opponents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we developed a set of algorithms that we believe will help us draft fantasy baseball players that will maximize our teams performance within our league. In other words, our algorithms will help us draft the ideal players for out playing our league opponents. We split these algorithms into two unique sets - one for pitchers and one for batters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and Statistics ###\n",
    "The pitching algorithms are relatively simple. We first took data from the 2018 MLB season (since this was the most recent season to present day). We then determined the fantasy score for all pitchers in this dataset. Note that a pitcher's fantasy score depended on the following statistics: \n",
    "* Innings Pitched (IP) = 5 points each\n",
    "* Strikeout (K) = 2 points each\n",
    "* Walk (BB) = -3 points each\n",
    "* Hit By Pitch (HBP) = -3 points each\n",
    "* Homerun (HR) = -13 points each\n",
    "* Save (SV) = 5 points each\n",
    "* Hold (HLD) = 4 points each\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we determined each pitchers fantasy score, we then determined each pitchers Wins Above Replacement (WAR) metric using the Fangraphs evaluation for WAR. We believed that WAR was the most significant statistic for choosing a fantasy pitcher because it compares a given pitchers stats to that of an average pitcher. By fault, the pitchers with higher WARs can be viewed as better pitchers compared to their league average replacements. We then determined the pitchers' final scores by taking a weighted sum of their WAR values and their fantasy scores. Note that we set up the weight proportions so that the maximum final score approximately equaled 40, which is equivalent to the maximum amount of money we would be willing to spend for a pitcher. With the weights set up this way, our pitcher selection algorithm not only determines a score for a pitcher, but it also determines a maximum amount of money to spend on said player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the batting algorithms we took the data from the 2018 MLB season and used that to create the fantasy score for all of the offensive players in the dataset. For the batting algorithm we did not use the traditional WAR statisitc as defense does not matter in terms of scoring fantasy points. As it is pointed out in the assignment however, we still are going to want to be able to determine a player's skill relative to their position so that we place higher value on players who score high points from positions that are not as \"deep\".  A batter's fantasy score depends on the following statistics: \n",
    "* At Bats (AB) = -1\n",
    "* Hits (H) = 5.6\n",
    "* Doubles (2B) = 2.9\n",
    "* Triples (3B) = 5.7\n",
    "* Home Runs (HR) = 9.4\n",
    "* Walks (BB) = 3\n",
    "* Hit by Pitch (HBP) = 3\n",
    "* Stolen Bases (SB) = 1.9\n",
    "* Caught Stealing (CS) = -2.8\n",
    "\n",
    "So we took the overall results from the 2018 season and then modify that number based on their relative skill level within the position and weighting to determine the maximum amount of money to spend on the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results ###\n",
    "The results for the pitchers algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "TOP FIVE PITCHERS:\n",
    "* Jacob deGrom - MAX we will pay: \\$40.47\n",
    "* Max Scherzer - MAX we will pay: \\$34.74\n",
    "* Justin Verlander - MAX we will pay: \\$33.48\n",
    "* Patrick Corben - MAX we will pay: \\$32.40\n",
    "* Gerrit Cole - MAX we will pay: \\$31.62\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: as mentioned above the max amount that we will pay a given pitcher is equivalent to our algorithm's rating of that pitcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive this rating by looking at Justin Verlander as an example. Verlander had the following stats in 2018:\n",
    "* IP: 214\n",
    "* K: 290\n",
    "* BB: 37\n",
    "* HBP: 8\n",
    "* HR: 28\n",
    "* SV: 0\n",
    "* HLD: 0\n",
    "* WAR: 6.9\n",
    "By applying point values to each of Verlander's stats above, we were able to determine that Verlander's fantasy score equaled 1151. The tuned weights for fantasy score and WAR equaled .05 and 3.185 respectively. Therefore, Verlander's final score using our system euqaled .01*1151 + 3.185*6.9 = 33.4865, which also equates to the absolute maximum amount of money we would be willing to spend on him.\n",
    "\n",
    "TOP FIVE BATTERS:\n",
    "* Jose Ramirez :\n",
    "MAX Amount we will Pay: $ 47.08\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mookie Betts :\n",
    "MAX Amount we will Pay: $ 46.23\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mike Trout :\n",
    "MAX Amount we will Pay: $ 45.69\n",
    "\n",
    "* Christian Yelich :\n",
    "MAX Amount we will Pay: $ 44.03\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alex Bregman :\n",
    "MAX Amount we will Pay: $ 41.39 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations ###\n",
    "One limitation of our pitching metric is that severe \"skewedness\" of the final metric we use for pitcher evaluation. Since some pitchers acquired massive stats in 2018, their final scores were considerably higher compared to the rest of the average pitchers. Due to this skew in the data, our top pitchers have incredibly large salary caps that could get us into trouble during the draft. That is, if we go big on one of these pitchers, we will most likely have to compromise with average pitchers for the remainder of our team. Come crunch time, it may be difficult to determine which average pitchers we want to draft if we have already drafted a big name pitcher.<br>\n",
    "A limitation on the batting metrics is that stats are going to skew heavily in favor or players who were not injured last season because the majority of the weight comes from their total batting numbers acrossed all of the games. So if a player is out for part of the season due to injury, or was rested or benched for some period of the season that is going to strongly impact the fantasy score that they received with our system.\n"
